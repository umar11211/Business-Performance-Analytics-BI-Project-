This project aims to analyze sales trends, customer behavior, product performance,
and the impact of marketing campaigns using Power BI. The goal is to gain
actionable insights that can help optimize sales strategies, improve marketing efforts,
and manage inventory effectively. The project is based on data provided from various
tables including orders, order details, marketing campaigns, suppliers, customers,
and inventory.
The insights derived will help in identifying the top-performing products,
understanding customer purchasing behavior, and evaluating the effectiveness of
marketing campaigns.
The project utilizes Power BI for data visualization and analysis, while data is
sourced from Excel files.
There are few steps before diving deep into analysis:
* Loading the data
* Data Modelling
* Data Preprocessing (data cleaning, removing irrelevant values, handling
  outliers, standardizing the data)
* Creating new measures
* Data Visualization
* Dashboard creation
